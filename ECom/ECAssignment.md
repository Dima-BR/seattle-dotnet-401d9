# Extra Credit

For a maximum of up to 50 extra credit points to be awarded within the LABS category, please conduct a review on one of your classmate's ecommerce site. Do not evaluate your own project.

A list of all your classmate's projects if found in your GH class repo.

## How to Peer Review

A copy of the rubric is located [HERE](https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-dotnet-guide/Curriculum/ECom_Project/EComECRubric).

For each criteria:
1. Read the requirements for each criteria
2. Evaluate both the deployed site and code base located on GH
3. Within Canvas text submission or a separate document, write your notes about each criteria. Be sure to include which section you are writing notes about. If I am not able to clearly see what section you are writing notes about, you will not be given credit. Keep each section clean, and separate than the rest. use Headers, line spacing, etc....
4. Provide feedback about what you see.

Be as accurate as possible and provide feedback for as necessary. 
1. If you like their implementation - give them points - and tell me why in the comments. Solo Statements like "No comment, it looks great!" will not be accepted. 
2. if you didn't like their implementation, or it does not meet the criteria - deduct points - and tell me why in the comments.
3. You will need access to the Admin panel, be sure to reach out to the owner of the project, or look in the source code and figure out what you need to do to get access to the admin. 
 
If I agree with your overall grading and comments, you will be awarded full 50 extra credit points. 
If there are places where I think you could have put in a bit more effort, points will be removed where appropriate.

It is recommended that this extra credit assignment should take approx. 90 min for you to complete to do a good/complete job on. Feel free to connect with the team you are reviewing to get access to the admin panel/credentials, as that is a large part of the site and still needs to be evaluated.
